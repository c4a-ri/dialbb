# Introduction

[DialBB (Dialogue System Development Framework with Building Blocks)](https://github.com/c4a-ri/dialbb) is a framework for building dialogue systems.  

Dialogue systems are constructed by integrating various technologies in the information technology field. Using this framework, we aim to enable people with little knowledge of dialogue system technology and little experience in information system development to construct dialogue systems and learn various information technologies.  We also aim to make DialBB easy to understand the architecture, highly extensible, and easy to read code, so that it can be used as a teaching material for programming and system development education. 

Please see the [README](https://github.com/c4a-ri/dialbb/blob/main/README.md) for instructions on how to install DialBB and how to run the sample application.
