# Appendix

## Discontinued Features

### Snips Understander Built-in Block

As Snips has become challenging to install with Python 3.9 and above, it was discontinued in version 0.9. Please use the LR-CRF Understander built-in block as an alternative.

### Whitespace Tokenizer and Sudachi Tokenizer Built-in Blocks

These blocks were discontinued in version 0.9. If you use LR-CRF Understander or ChatGPT Understander, there is no need for the Tokenizer blocks.

### Snips+STN Sample Application

This sample application was discontinued in version 0.9.
